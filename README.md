# Aban.
 A Game Engine

#### Warning:
 I use Windows x64 for now. Building for other platforms is possible but you need to:
 1) Replace SDL2 library (located at 'src-c/sdl') with your target platform.
 2) Tweak 'src-c/CMakeLists.txt' to use proper library files. (Especially for switching to 32-bit build.)
 3) Copy an SDL2 dynamic library file (e.g. SDL2.dll on Windows) next to final executable file. (e.g. 'build/src-c/Debug/Aban.exe)

#### Final words:
 Thank you for checking out this repository. As you can see nothings here to show off. Came later. Things may change.
